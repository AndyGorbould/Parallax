## Spicy!

Ironically, this project is far lower on the [Scoville Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) than some of our recent work!

Add js listener for scroll, fade out & scale up the title - this doesn't work as well as expected, due to everything being in a 'wrapper' div so I cannot find the 'window.scrollY' values - fixed by getBoundingClientRect() on the farthest image in the wrapper (background)

Add la cucaracha to catch ;)
